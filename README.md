# Rune-inator

A simple python script that takes runes from https://www.murderbridge.com and configures the runes in the League of Legends client.

## Requirements
First you need to download python3 from https://www.python.org/downloads/ 

You will need to install the following modules using pip. For windows the commands look like: 
  - C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python39>python.exe -m pip install requests-html
  - C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python39>python.exe -m pip install pyautogui
  - C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python39>python.exe -m pip install Pillow
  - C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python39>python.exe -m pip install opencv-python

# Running the script
To run the script, navigate to where you have python installed and run the "rune-inator.py" script:

```C:\Users\dumre\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python39>python.exe C:\Users\dumre\Rune-inator\rune-inator.py```

# Example
